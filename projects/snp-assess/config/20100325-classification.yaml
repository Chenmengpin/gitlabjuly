# Adjustable filtering and analysis parameters
# 
# * kmer-range -> Range of values for kmers to normalize around. Lower
#   kmer values are indicative of rare regions that are likely due to
#   mutation.
# * qual-range -> Range of read quality scores for normalization.
# * map-score-range -> Range of aligner mapping scores.
# * min-freq -> Bases below this frequency at a position are not
#   called.
# * allowed-freq-diff -> Difference allowed between expected and
#   actual frequency to count as correct call.
# * max-pos-pct -> Maximum minority variants to include in positive
#   classification group.
# * max-neg-pct -> Maximum minority variants to include in negative
#   classification group.
# * assess-bases -> Bases to perform assessment with a
#   classifier. Set to nil to include all bases.
# * algorithm -> Approach to use for classification. Choices:
#   linear-regression (default), random-forest
